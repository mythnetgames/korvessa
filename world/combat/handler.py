Combat Handler Module

The combat handler that manages turn-based combat for all combatants
in one or more locations. This module contains the core CombatHandler script
and utility functions for combat management.

This is the central component that orchestrates combat encounters, handling:
- Combat initialization and cleanup
- Turn management and initiative
- Multi-room combat coordination
- Combatant state management
- Integration with proximity and grappling systems
