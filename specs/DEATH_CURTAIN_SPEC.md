# Death Curtain Animation System

## Overview

The `curtain_of_death.py` module provides an elegant "dripping blood" death animation for characters in the Evennia MUD. This system creates a sophisticated visual effect by centering a death message in a "sea" of characters and progressively removing characters to create a dripping effect.

## Design Philosophy

This animation system is based on a beautiful and subtle design:

1. **Message-Centered**: Places a meaningful death message at the center of the animation
2. **Progressive Decay**: Characters "drip away" from the message in a planned sequence
3. **Visual Poetry**: Creates a sense of fading consciousness and dissolving reality
4. **Flexible**: Works with any death message, making it reusable
5. **Elegant**: The effect is subtle and artistic, not overwhelming

## Features

### Visual Effects
- **Dripping Animation**: Characters progressively disappear from the message in a randomized sequence
- **Color Variation**: Uses Evennia's color system with red variations for blood-like effect
- **Dynamic Timing**: Animation starts fast and slows down over time for dramatic effect
- **Centered Layout**: Message is centered in a "sea" of block characters

### Technical Features
- **Evennia-Native**: Uses Evennia's built-in `delay()` function and color system
- **Message Flexibility**: Can animate any text message
- **Character Messaging**: Integrates with standard Evennia character messaging
- **Observer Support**: Provides different messages for dying character vs. room observers
- **Configurable**: Timing, colors, and characters can be easily adjusted

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from typeclasses.curtain_of_death import show_death_curtain

# Use default death message
show_death_curtain(character)

# Use custom death message
show_death_curtain(character, "Your vision fades to black...")
```

### Integration with Character Death

```python
def at_death(self):
    from .curtain_of_death import show_death_curtain
    show_death_curtain(self)
```

### Testing with Various Messages

```
testdeathcurtain
testdeathcurtain You feel your strength ebbing away...
testdeathcurtain The darkness consumes you
testdeathcurtain A red haze blurs your vision as the world slips away...
```

## Implementation Details

### Core Algorithm

The animation works through these steps:

1. **Center the Message**: Place the death message in the center of a line filled with block characters (`|`)
2. **Create Removal Plan**: Generate a randomized sequence for removing characters
3. **Progressive Removal**: Remove characters one by one according to the plan
4. **Color Enhancement**: Apply random red-spectrum colors to remaining characters
5. **Final Frame**: Show the complete message one last time

### Key Functions

**`curtain_of_death(text, width=None)`**: Core animation generator
- Creates the sequence of frames for the dripping effect
- Handles message centering and character removal planning
- Applies Evennia color codes

**`DeathCurtain`**: Animation controller class
- Manages timing and frame display
- Handles character messaging
- Provides observer notifications

**`show_death_curtain(character, message=None)`**: Convenience function
- Easy integration point for character death
- Supports custom messages

### Animation Characteristics

```python
# Default message
"A red haze blurs your vision as the world slips away..."

# Frame progression example:
"...A red haze blurs your vision as the world slips away..."
"...A red haze blurs your vision as the world slips away..."
"...A red haze blurs your vision as the world slips away..."
"...A red haze blurs your vision as the world slips away..."
# ... continues until message dissolves
```

## Configuration

### Timing Parameters

```python
self.frame_delay = 0.015        # Starting delay between frames
self.delay_multiplier = 1.01    # Acceleration factor (gets slower)
```

### Visual Parameters

```python
_get_terminal_width()           # Width of animation area (default 78)
sea_char = "["                  # Character surrounding the message
replacement_char = "."          # Character used during dripping
```

### Color Customization

```python
colors = ["|r", "|R", "|y", "|Y"]  # Evennia color codes for effect
```

## Evennia Integration

### Color System Compatibility
- Uses Evennia's native color codes (`|r`, `|R`, `|y`, `|Y`, `|n`)
- Avoids conflicts with color parsing
- Properly terminates color sequences

### Messaging Patterns
- Standard `character.msg()` for dying character
- `location.msg_contents()` for observers
- Proper exclusion handling for room messaging

### Performance Considerations
- Pre-generates all frames for smooth playback
- Limits observer messages to reduce spam
- Uses efficient string operations

## Best Practices

### Message Design
- Keep messages under 60 characters for best visual effect
- Use evocative, atmospheric language
- Consider the pacing of the animation

### Integration Tips
- Test with various message lengths
- Consider context-specific death messages
- Integrate with existing death handling systems

### Performance Guidelines
- Monitor animation performance on slower connections
- Adjust timing for different server loads
- Consider client capabilities

## Examples

### Default Death Message
```python
show_death_curtain(character)
# Uses: "A red haze blurs your vision as the world slips away..."
```

### Custom Death Messages
```python
# Dramatic
show_death_curtain(character, "The darkness claims your soul...")

# Peaceful
show_death_curtain(character, "You drift away into eternal rest...")

# Violent
show_death_curtain(character, "Your blood pools beneath you...")

# Mystical
show_death_curtain(character, "Your essence fades into the void...")
```

## Recent Enhancements (Sept 2024)

### Medical System Integration
The death curtain now integrates with the medical system for informed death messaging:

#### Intelligent Death Cause Messages:
- **Cause Detection**: Uses existing `debug_death_analysis()` logic to determine death cause
- **Informed Messaging**: Shows specific causes like "blood loss", "heart failure", "respiratory failure"
- **Fallback Gracefully**: Returns to beautiful mixed red message if cause detection fails

#### Message Flow:
1. **Initial Death Messages**: Both victim and observers get cause-specific messages
   - Victim: "Your body succumbs to blood loss. The end draws near..."
   - Observers: "Nick Kramer is dying from blood loss..."
2. **Death Curtain**: Always uses the beautiful mixed red message for immersion
3. **Final Notification**: "Nick Kramer has died." for observers

### Visual Improvements
Fixed color and centering issues for optimal presentation:

#### Color Code Fixes:
- **Proper Color Parsing**: Text centering now accounts for color code length
- **Random Block Coloring**: Each ▓ and █ character gets random |r or |R coloring
- **Preserved Message Colors**: Original mixed red death message maintains perfect coloring

#### Centering Algorithm:
- **Visible Length Calculation**: Strips color codes before calculating padding
- **Accurate Centering**: Message appears properly centered regardless of color complexity
- **Clean Animation**: No more malformed frames from color code counting errors

### Race Condition Prevention
Eliminated message conflicts between death curtain and medical system:

#### Medical Message Suppression:
- **Bleeding Messages**: All "lifeless body" messages suppressed for dead characters
- **Clean Narrative**: Death curtain gets exclusive control over death messaging
- **No Interference**: Medical ticker won't interrupt death animation with bleeding updates

#### Timing Coordination:
- **Pre-Curtain Messages**: Initial death cause messages sent before animation starts
- **Exclusive Animation**: Medical system stays silent during death curtain
- **Post-Animation**: Final death confirmation after curtain completes

### Technical Refinements
Multiple technical improvements for robustness and maintainability:

#### Color Code Handling:
```python
def _strip_color_codes(text):
    """Remove Evennia color codes to get visible text length."""
    return re.sub(r'\|.', '', text)
```

#### Smart Message Selection:
- **Cause-Based Selection**: Uses medical analysis for informed messages when available
- **Elegant Fallback**: Always has beautiful default message as backup
- **Consistent Experience**: Both paths provide rich, atmospheric death experience

## Death Progression Configuration

The death system consists of two parts: the death curtain animation (~5-10 seconds) followed by a configurable death progression timer.

### Configuration Constants

All death progression timing is controlled in `world/combat/constants.py`:

```python
# Death progression timing
DEATH_PROGRESSION_DURATION = 90           # Total time before permanent death (seconds)
DEATH_PROGRESSION_CHECK_INTERVAL = 30     # How often to check and send messages (seconds)
DEATH_PROGRESSION_MESSAGE_COUNT = 11      # Number of progression messages to send
```

### Common Configurations

**Production (Default):**
```python
DEATH_PROGRESSION_DURATION = 360          # 6 minutes - full dramatic experience
```

**Testing:**
```python
DEATH_PROGRESSION_DURATION = 90           # 90 seconds - faster iteration
DEATH_PROGRESSION_DURATION = 60           # 60 seconds - very fast testing
```

### How It Works

1. **Death Curtain** → Animation plays (~5-10 seconds)
2. **Death Progression** → Timer begins with periodic messages
3. **Medical Window** → Characters can attempt revival during this time
4. **Final Death** → After duration expires, permanent death occurs

Messages are automatically distributed evenly across the total duration. For example, with 90 seconds and 11 messages, they appear every ~8 seconds.

To apply changes: Edit constants, then `@reload` or restart the server.

## Future Enhancements

- **Multiple Sea Characters**: Different background patterns for different death types
- **Color Themes**: Ice (blue), fire (red/orange), nature (green), etc.
- **Speed Variations**: Different timing profiles for different death causes
- **Sound Integration**: Audio cues synchronized with visual effects
- **Multi-line Support**: Animate longer death messages across multiple lines

## Technical Notes

### Algorithm Beauty
The core algorithm elegantly balances:
- **Randomness**: Unpredictable character removal creates organic feel
- **Structure**: Planned sequence ensures complete message dissolution
- **Timing**: Progressive slowdown creates dramatic pacing
- **Flexibility**: Same system works for any message length

### Performance Characteristics
- **Memory Efficient**: Generates frames on-demand
- **Network Friendly**: Sends complete frames, not incremental changes
- **Server Optimized**: Uses Evennia's delay system for proper scheduling
