## Quick Tips

- **Passwords**: Remember to save! You only see them once.
- **Multiple Handles**: Create different ones for different purposes

- **Search**: Use `sn/search keyword` to find old posts
- **Security**: Upgrade your ICE rating to prevent hacking
- **Privacy**: DMs are private unless someone hacks you

## Feeds

| Feed | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **public** | General discussion |
| **market** | Buy/sell/trade |
| **rumors** | Gossip and hearsay |
| **jobs** | Work opportunities |

## Password Format

SafetyNet passwords are two cyberpunk-themed words:

```
neon-phantom
chrome-runner
glitch-nexus
```

**Case doesn't matter** - `NEON-PHANTOM` works fine!

## Connection Speeds

| Device | Speed | Best For |
|--------|-------|----------|
| **Wristpad** | Slow (2-5s) | Mobile access |
| **Computer** | Fast (0.3-1s) | Serious work |

## Problem Solver

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Can't access SafetyNet | Find a Wristpad or Computer first |
| "Already logged in as..." | Use `sn/logout` first |
| "Invalid password" | Check spelling (hyphen is there?) |
| Lost password? | Contact staff for help |
| No posts showing? | Try `sn/read public/next` for older posts |
| DM not received? | Recipient must be logged in or check inbox |

## Remember!

1. **Save your passwords** - No recovery system!
2. **Posts expire** after 72 hours
3. **One password** per handle only
4. **Be careful** what you post publicly
5. **ICE protects** your account from hacking

## Hacking Protection

- **ICE Rating**: Higher = harder to hack
- **Online Status**: Logged in characters are safer
- **Upgrade Cost**: Varies by game

## Emergency Contact

If you have problems:
- Contact **staff** for account help
- Check **sn/help** in-game for command help
- Read [SAFETYNET_PLAYER_GUIDE.md](SAFETYNET_PLAYER_GUIDE.md) for detailed info
