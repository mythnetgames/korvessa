# KORVESSA – COPILOT / STAFF AGENT GUIDE

> Internal Staff Reference  
> RP-First | Low Fantasy | Consequence-Driven

---

## 0. Prime Directive

Korvessa is **not** a power fantasy, a build game, or a mechanical sandbox.

Korvessa is:
- Socially reactive
- Danger-forward
- Narrative-first
- Slow-progression
- Consequence-heavy

Every ruling, system, and exception must reinforce:
- **Risk over optimization**
- **Story over efficiency**
- **Reputation over anonymity**
- **Time over instant reward**

If a decision makes the world safer, faster, or cleaner without narrative cost, it is probably wrong.

---

## 1. Core Design Philosophy (Enforcement Layer)

### 1.1 Low Fantasy Means

- Magic exists but is **external**, **divine**, **ritualized**, and **controlled**
- Players do not mechanically solve problems with magic
- Ritual outcomes are story tools, not buttons

If a system allows a player to bypass:
- Injury
- Social consequences
- Labor
- Time

…it violates Korvessa’s vision.

---

## 2. Character Stats – Interpretation & Adjudication

Stats are **modifiers**, not identities.

A high stat:
- Improves odds
- Does not negate difficulty
- Never guarantees success

### 2.1 Stat Enforcement Notes

**STR**
- Governs physical dominance, not endurance
- Strong characters still tire
- Lifting or forcing actions draw attention

**DEX**
- Precision and agility, not invisibility
- High DEX does not negate witnesses or noise

**CON**
- Extends survivability, not immunity
- High CON characters still suffer injuries

**INT**
- Governs learning and analysis
- Does not grant instant understanding
- Lore still requires context and access

**WIS**
- Intuition and perception
- Does not reveal truth, only hints
- False positives are valid outcomes

**CHA**
- Alters starting attitude, not loyalty
- Does not override faction doctrine
- Fear and charm have consequences

---

## 3. Personality System – Class Architecture Rules

Personalities:
- Are chosen **only at character creation**
- Are not professions
- Are not prestige paths
- Do not upgrade or evolve mechanically

### 3.1 Staff Enforcement

A personality:
- Defines *how* the world initially treats the character
- Does not define *what* they can become

If a player attempts to:
- Stack personalities
- Reframe them as classes
- Treat them as lifelong mechanical engines

Staff response:
- Deny
- Redirect to RP development
- Apply social friction if abused IC

---

## 4. XP Economy – Oversight & Abuse Prevention

### 4.1 Daily Cap (200 XP)

The cap exists to:
- Prevent grind dominance
- Encourage downtime
- Normalize pacing

Staff should **never** casually override the cap.

If XP is awarded beyond the cap:
- It must be story-significant
- It must be logged
- It must have visible narrative cost

### 4.2 XP Spending as World Impact

XP purchases are **world edits**, not perks.

Examples:
- NPC interactions alter social webs
- Businesses alter economic flows
- Plot progression reshapes zones

Staff should ask:
- Who notices?
- Who resents this?
- What pressure does this create?

---

## 5. Skills System – Slow Growth Enforcement

### 5.1 Proficiency Caps Are Hard Limits

- 80% without teachers is a ceiling
- Teachers must exist IC
- Teachers have agendas, limits, and costs

No exceptions without:
- Narrative justification
- Staff consensus
- Long-term consequences

### 5.2 Grinding Detection

Signs of grind abuse:
- Repeated low-risk actions
- Isolated skill cycling
- No social or narrative engagement

Corrective actions:
- Diminishing returns
- Social complications
- Fatigue or injury
- NPC suspicion

Never punish silently. The world reacts.

---

## 6. Combat System – Adjudication Doctrine

Combat is:
- Slow
- Costly
- Visible
- Socially disruptive

### 6.1 Combat Is Not a Solution

If players default to violence:
- Guards escalate
- Reputation shifts
- Factions intervene
- Access closes

### 6.2 Retreat Is Not Free

Retreat:
- Costs stamina
- Risks pursuit
- Leaves witnesses

Escaping repeatedly without consequence is invalid.

---

## 7. Healing & Injury – Narrative Weight

Healing systems exist to:
- Force downtime
- Encourage reliance on others
- Create scars (physical and social)

### 7.1 Injury Enforcement

Do not:
- Handwave recovery
- Fast-forward critical wounds casually
- Allow "sleep it off" for major injuries

Injuries should:
- Affect behavior
- Be visible
- Invite RP

---

## 8. Social Standing – World Reaction Engine

Standing is **memory**.

NPCs:
- Remember patterns
- Share opinions
- Act collectively

### 8.1 Threshold Enforcement

Crossing tiers should:
- Trigger new NPC behavior
- Unlock or close options
- Alter rumor flow

Standing loss is easier than gain.  
Recovery requires **time and visibility**.

---

## 9. Character Creation Oversight

### 9.1 Character Facts Are Mandatory Reality Anchors

No character enters as:
- Unknown
- Untouched
- Unremarkable without cause

Character Facts:
- Must be plausible
- Must be grounded
- Must create hooks

If a background creates no social vectors, it is invalid.

---

## 10. Public Knowledge Rolls – Staff Usage

These rolls:
- Do not reveal truth
- Reveal perception
- Can be wrong, biased, or outdated

Staff should:
- Provide fragments
- Encourage uncertainty
- Seed rumors, not answers

---

## 11. Magic Restrictions – Absolute Rule

Players do not cast spells.

Rituals:
- Are staff-mediated
- Carry risk
- Have costs
- Leave marks

Any attempt to:
- Mechanize magic
- Repeat rituals safely
- Min-max divine outcomes

Should be shut down immediately.

---

## 12. Staff Commands – Proper Use

### 12.1 Command Philosophy

Commands are:
- Surgical tools
- Not convenience buttons

Every command use should answer:
- Why did this happen IC?
- Who caused it?
- Who notices?

### 12.2 Abuse Red Flags

- Frequent EDABILITY use without RP
- Standing edits without scenes
- Injury removal without recovery time

If a fix is needed, create a cause.

---

## 13. Copilot Decision Tree (Quick Reference)

When unsure, ask:

1. Does this slow the world down?
2. Does this create consequence?
3. Does this invite others into the story?
4. Does this leave marks on reputation, body, or memory?

If the answer to two or more is "no":
- Do not allow it
- Reframe it
- Add cost

---

## 14. Final Enforcement Principle

Korvessa is not fair.  
It is **consistent**.

Consistency builds trust.  
Danger builds meaning.  
Memory builds a world.

If players feel safe, anonymous, or powerful without cost, something has gone wrong.
