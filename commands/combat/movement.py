Movement Combat Commands Module

Contains commands related to movement and positioning in combat:
- CmdFlee: Attempt to flee from combat or aiming
- CmdRetreat: Disengage from melee proximity within the same room
- CmdAdvance: Close distance with a target
- CmdCharge: Recklessly charge at a target

These commands handle the tactical movement aspects of combat,
allowing players to control distance and positioning strategically.

    Attempt to flee from an aimer or combat.

    Usage:
      flee

    If someone is aiming at you, you will first attempt to break their aim.
    If successful, or if no one was aiming at you and you are in combat,
    you will attempt to escape the current combat and leave the room.
    You cannot flee into a room where an opponent is already targeting
    you with a ranged weapon.
    
    Flee occurs instantly but consumes your combat action. You can only
    attempt to flee once per combat round to prevent spam.
    
    If you fail any step, you remain in place and skip your next combat turn.
    Cannot be used if you are currently grappled in combat.
    If you disengage from local attackers but cannot find a safe exit, you remain in combat.

    Perform heroic explosive sacrifice or tactical descent/gap jumping.

    Usage:
      jump on <explosive>           # Heroic sacrifice - absorb explosive damage
      jump off <direction> edge     # Tactical descent from elevated position  
      jump across <direction> edge  # Horizontal leap across gaps at same level

    Examples:
      jump on grenade              # Absorb grenade blast to protect others
      jump off north edge          # Descend from rooftop/balcony to north
      jump across east edge        # Leap across gap to the east

    The jump command serves heroic and tactical functions. Jumping on explosives
    provides complete protection to others in proximity at the cost of taking all
    damage yourself. Edge jumping allows vertical descent from elevated positions
    or horizontal gap crossing with risk/reward mechanics.

    All edge jumps require Motorics skill checks and may result in falling if failed.
    Explosive sacrifice is instant and always succeeds but consumes your life for others.
