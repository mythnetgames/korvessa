TOPIC: Renting a Cube

Cubes are small rental rooms available throughout the city. Here is how to rent
and use one.

FINDING A CUBE
==============

Cubes are located in various buildings throughout the city. Look for an exit
leading to a cube door - you can CHECK a direction to see if a cube is there.

CHECKING A CUBE
===============

Usage: check <direction>

Before renting, you can check the status of a cube door to see its cost and
whether it's available for rent.

Examples:
  check north
  check e

The command will show:
  - Nightly Rate: The daily cost to rent the cube
  - Rental Status: Either "Paid - X days remaining" or "Available for rent"

RENTING A CUBE
==============

Usage: pay rent <direction> [= <amount>]

To rent an unoccupied cube, use the pay rent command. This will:
  1. Claim the cube as your rental
  2. Generate a unique access code for you
  3. Deduct the payment from your cash on hand
  4. Add rent time to the cube

Examples:
  pay rent north          (Pay all your cash)
  pay rent n = 500        (Pay exactly 500 dollars)
  pay rent east = 100     (Pay exactly 100 dollars)

The rate is 100 dollars per day of rent. Partial payments are accepted.

You will receive a message with:
  - Your unique 6-character access code (remember this!)
  - How much rent time was added
  - When your rent expires

CHECKING YOUR CASH
==================

Usage: count

Before renting, check how much cash you have on hand with the COUNT command.

ENTERING YOUR CUBE
==================

Usage: enter <code> <direction>

Once you have rented a cube and received your access code, you can enter your
room using the ENTER command.

Examples:
  enter ABC123 north
  enter XY7Z9K n

The code is case-insensitive. If the code is correct and your rent is paid,
the door will unlock and you can enter.

MESSAGES YOU'LL SEE
===================

If the door is locked (wrong code):
  "The keypad beeps angrily. A red indicator flashes."

If rent has expired:
  "The keypad buzzes. Payment required. A red indicator flashes."

If the code is correct:
  "The keypad chirps once. The door swings open."

EXTENDING YOUR RENT
===================

You can pay rent at any time to extend the duration. Use the same PAY RENT
command to add more time to your cube.

SHARING YOUR CUBE
=================

Once inside, you can invite other players to stay with you. However, they will
need your access code to enter. You can share your code with trusted players.

CLOSING THE DOOR
================

Usage: close door

When inside your cube, you can close and lock the door behind you with the
CLOSE DOOR command.

LOSING YOUR RENTAL
==================

If you don't pay your rent by the expiration date, your rental will expire and
someone else can rent the cube. You will lose any belongings left inside.

Always pay your rent on time!
