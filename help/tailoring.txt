TAILORING & CLOTHING

Tailoring is a knowledge skill that allows you to design valuable, wearable clothing. Your TAILORING skill affects the quality and value of finished garments. Low skill means lower value items.

Changing any messages on a @finalize'd article will render it unfinalized and unwearable until @finalize'd again.

PRONOUN TOKENS

Use these instead of gender pronouns (his/her) so clothing works for any wearer:
  %p - possessive (his/her/their)
  %s - subjective (he/she/they)  
  %o - objective (him/her/them)
  %r - reflexive (himself/herself/themselves)
  %n - character's name

Example: "This dress makes %p butt look big." becomes "This dress makes her butt look big." or "This dress makes his butt look big."

CLOTHING NAMING & LAYERING

Certain words in the name determine which layer the clothing is worn at. You cannot wear a bra (Layer 0) over a trenchcoat (Layer 4).

Layer 0 (Undergarments): bikini, panties, underwear, bra, thong, boxers, g-string, sock, stockings

Layer 1 (Base Clothing): Default layer for anything not listed elsewhere

Layer 2 (Accessories): blindfold, glasses, vest

Layer 3 (Outer Wear): jacket, waistcoat

Layer 4 (Heavy Outerwear): tailcoat, coat, labcoat, topcoat, overcoat, longcoat, greatcoat, browncoat, trenchcoat, watchcoat, trench, robe, habit, muumuu, hawaiian, bolero, apron, scrubs, bathrobe, armband, obi, duster

Layer 5 (Top Layer): tie, boots, cane, umbrella, blindfold, habit, shawl, scarf, armband, necktie, cummerbund, belt, veil, parka, balaclava, bandana, sticker, badge

TAILORING COMMANDS

@tname <material>=<name>
  Set the name of your fresh material. The name determines the layer.

@coverage <material>=<locations>
  Configure which body locations the clothing covers.
  Use @coverage/list to see all valid locations.
  Example: @coverage fresh cloth=chest,back,abdomen

@color <material>=<hex_code>:<color_name>
  Set the primary color using xterm 256 hex codes.

  Use %color in descriptions to insert the colored text.
  
  Common hex codes:
    000000 = black       ff0000 = red         00ff00 = green
    0000ff = blue        ffff00 = yellow      ff00ff = magenta

@check <material>
