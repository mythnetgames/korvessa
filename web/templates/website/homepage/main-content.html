    In the sprawling expanse of Kowloon, survival is a daily struggle. The colony is a melting pot 
    of outcasts, mercenaries, hackers, and scavengers, all vying for resources and power. The 
    environment is harsh, with treacherous terrain and unpredictable weather patterns that can turn 
    deadly in an instant. Trust is a rare commodity, and alliances are often temporary and fragile.

    Technology is both a boon and a bane in Kowloon. Advanced cybernetic enhancements and 
    sophisticated weaponry are commonplace, but they come at a cost. The line between human and 
    machine is blurred, leading to ethical dilemmas and identity crises. Hackers wield immense power, 
    capable of manipulating systems and information to their advantage, but they must constantly 
    evade detection from corporate security forces and rival factions.

                                    Welcome to the Walled City.
