"""
Curtain of Death - Death Animation System for Evennia

This module provides a "dripping blood" death animation that creates
a curtain effect by progressively removing characters from a message.
Based on the elegant design that centers text in a "sea" of characters
and creates a dripping effect by removing characters in sequence.
Compatible with Evennia's messaging and delay systems.
