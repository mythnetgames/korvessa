"""
Death Progression Script - Time-Delayed Death System

This script creates a dramatic window between death and final death,
allowing for medical intervention and creating suspenseful RP opportunities.

The system works as follows:
1. Character "dies" - death curtain plays, they enter dying state
2. Timer begins with periodic progression messages
3. Other characters can attempt revival during this window
4. After time expires, final death occurs (permanent until manual revival)

Duration is configurable via DEATH_PROGRESSION_DURATION in world/combat/constants.py:
- Default: 360 seconds (6 minutes) - provides RP and revival window
- Testing: Can be reduced to 60 (1 minute) or 120 (2 minutes) for faster iteration

This creates urgency for medical response while making death less instantaneous.
