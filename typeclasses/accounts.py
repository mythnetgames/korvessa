Account

The Account represents the game "account" and each login has only one
Account object. An Account is what chats on default channels but has no
other in-game-world existence. Rather the Account puppets Objects (such
as Characters) in order to actually participate in the game world.


Guest

Guest accounts are simple low-level accounts that are created/deleted
on the fly and allows users to test the game without the commitment
of a full registration. Guest accounts are deactivated by default; to
activate them, add the following line to your settings file:

    GUEST_ENABLED = True

You will also need to modify the connection screen to reflect the
possibility to connect with a guest account. The setting file accepts
several more options for customizing the Guest account system.

class Account(DefaultAccount):
    """
    An Account is the actual OOC player entity. It doesn't exist in the game,
    but puppets characters.

    This is the base Typeclass for all Accounts. Accounts represent
    the person playing the game and tracks account info, password
    etc. They are OOC entities without presence in-game. An Account
    can connect to a Character Object in order to "enter" the
    game.

    Account Typeclass API:

    * Available properties (only available on initiated typeclass objects)

     - key (string) - name of account
     - name (string)- wrapper for user.username
     - aliases (list of strings) - aliases to the object. Will be saved to
            database as AliasDB entries but returned as strings.
     - dbref (int, read-only) - unique #id-number. Also "id" can be used.
     - date_created (string) - time stamp of object creation
     - permissions (list of strings) - list of permission strings
     - user (User, read-only) - django User authorization object
     - obj (Object) - game object controlled by account. 'character' can also
                     be used.
     - is_superuser (bool, read-only) - if the connected user is a superuser

    * Handlers

     - locks - lock-handler: use locks.add() to add new lock strings
     - db - attribute-handler: store/retrieve database attributes on this
                              self.db.myattr=val, val=self.db.myattr
     - ndb - non-persistent attribute handler: same as db but does not
                                  create a database entry when storing data
     - scripts - script-handler. Add new scripts to object with scripts.add()
     - cmdset - cmdset-handler. Use cmdset.add() to add new cmdsets to object
     - nicks - nick-handler. New nicks with nicks.add().
     - sessions - session-handler. Use session.get() to see all sessions connected, if any
     - options - option-handler. Defaults are taken from settings.OPTIONS_ACCOUNT_DEFAULT
     - characters - handler for listing the account's playable characters
